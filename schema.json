In addition, work with the person to identify barriers to empowerment—whether physical, social, cognitive, emotional or environmental—and determine strategies to address them. Where relevant, assist the person in accessing advocacy services and complaint mechanisms in accordance with their rights and your organisation’s procedures. Your demonstration must include working with at least two individuals—one in a simulated environment and one in the workplace—where you employ flexible, adaptable, and person-centred support practices that respond to their individual goals and aspirations. You must provide at least one service or support that has been adjusted through consultation with the person to meet their needs and propose at least one strategy to meet their health or reablement goals. Throughout, you are expected to recognise and respond appropriately to barriers or challenging situations, use communication techniques tailored to the person’s abilities and needs, and facilitate empowerment and respectful relationships. You must demonstrate understanding of strategies that help people exercise their rights and support independent thinking and action, including the use of technology to promote choice, the right to privacy, and the right to participate in all decisions regarding their care and support. Your demonstration should reflect knowledge of the scope and application of assistive technologies across all life domains—such as self-care, continence and hygiene, communication, cognition and memory loss, mobility, education, employment, recreation, and daily living. You must also explain how assistive technologies help maintain independence and enable inclusion and participation. Finally, you must show that you understand how to access and support the use of advocacy services and complaint mechanisms to protect the person’s rights.",

        "assessment_guide": "Comprehensive Role Play Scenario for Following Established Person-Centred Behaviour Supports\n\nContext Overview\nYou are a support worker providing care to individuals who display behaviours of concern. Your role involves implementing person-centred strategies outlined in the individualised behaviour support plan while working within your scope and adhering to legal, ethical, and organisational requirements.\nYou will support the person’s wellbeing, participate in monitoring behaviour triggers and responses, and collaborate with supervisors to ensure safety and effectiveness of behavioural interventions. Accurate documentation and reflective practice are integral to the role.\n\nApplicability for Role Play\nThis scenario is intended for use in a simulated environment that closely mirrors real support situations involving behaviours of concern. It allows students to practise respectful support, behavioural monitoring, positive intervention, and documentation. \n\nSimulated Workplace Stakeholders\nYour Assessor: May act as the person with behaviours of concern, a supervisor, or a team member.\nInvited Participants: May portray family members, behaviour support practitioners, or co-workers.\n\nAssessor Responsibilities\nEnsure that scenarios reflect safe and ethical handling of behaviours of concern.\nObserve the student’s use of person-centred techniques and documentation accuracy.\nRecord whether stakeholders were real or simulated.\n\nRole Play Purpose\nThis role play allows the student to demonstrate the ability to:\nApply person-centred behavioural supports.\nMonitor and respond to behaviours of concern.\nImplement strategies according to individualised plans.\nDocument accurately and consult collaboratively.\n\nScenario Preparation\nKey Learning Points for CHCCCS044 Alignment\nPerson-Centred Behaviour Support:\no Engage individuals in a way that respects their strengths, dignity, and preferences.\no Identify and respond to motivation challenges and environmental safety concerns.\nReviewing Context of Behaviours:\no Observe patterns, triggers, and environmental or emotional factors linked to behaviour.\no Record behavioural observations objectively and consultatively.\nProviding Positive Behaviour Support:\no Follow behaviour support strategies and safety protocols.\no Recognise and report changes in behaviour, needs, or safety.\nCompleting Documentation:\no Document interventions and behaviours clearly and accurately.\no Maintain confidentiality and adhere to policies for access and storage.\n\nSteps for Role Play\nScenario 1: Applying Person-Centred Behaviour Support\nPurpose: To provide support that aligns with the person’s needs and behaviour support plan.\nActions:\nEngage with the person during an activity of daily living, incorporating their preferences and strengths.\nIdentify a motivational challenge (e.g. refusal to attend a program) and seek guidance from your supervisor.\nMake the environment calm and predictable to support adaptive responses.\n\nScenario 2: Reviewing Context of Behaviours of Concern\nPurpose: To observe, assess, and document behaviour patterns.\nActions:\nIdentify and describe a behaviour of concern (e.g. verbal outbursts, withdrawal) and what occurred before, during, and after.\nConsider health, emotional, environmental, or medication factors influencing the behaviour.\nRecord observations using objective language and consult with your supervisor for review.\n\nScenario 3: Providing Positive Behaviour Support\nPurpose: To implement strategies and manage behaviour safely.\nActions:\nFollow behaviour support strategies (e.g. use of redirection, reinforcement) as outlined in the plan.\nRespond appropriately to a simulated critical incident (e.g. a person throws an object), ensuring safety and reporting.\nMonitor the effectiveness of the intervention and consult with your supervisor about potential changes.\n\nScenario 4: Completing Documentation\nPurpose: To record behavioural incidents and interventions accurately.\nActions:\nComplete a behaviour incident report using workplace documentation.\nStore the record securely and in accordance with the person’s right to access.\nReflect briefly with a supervisor about the impact of your actions and any follow-up needed.\n\nAssessment Criteria\nAssessors will evaluate your ability to:\nApply a person-centred approach while implementing behaviour support strategies.\nRecognise and document behavioural patterns, triggers, and contributing factors.\nImplement interventions safely and in line with established support plans.\nRespond to behavioural risks and critical incidents appropriately.\nAccurately complete, maintain, and store documentation.\n\nExpected Outcomes\nBy the end of the role play, the student should:\nRespectfully support the person using individualised behavioural strategies.\nRecognise behavioural influences and patterns, and respond appropriately.\nMaintain a safe environment and follow escalation protocols when necessary.\nDocument and store behavioural data according to organisational procedures and the person’s rights.\n\nAssessment Conditions Checklist\nFor Assessor:\n☒ The
