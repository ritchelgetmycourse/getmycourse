In your response, please include the following: Observing and identifying emerging pro-social skills, Documenting strategies used by educators, Reviewing pre-existing information regarding the child’s interactions and behaviour, Reviewing the physical and social environment, Observing and monitoring interactions and responses, Participating in collaborative discussions, Documenting own reflections, Developing, implementing, and evaluating a support plan, Observing and identifying emerging pro-social skills,",
            "benchMarkAns": "Observing and identifying emerging pro-social skills \nChild A: 4 years old – difficulty with sharing and turn-taking\n1. Observing and identifying emerging pro-social skillsThu conducted three structured observations during play-based activities (block play, outdoor games, and group art). She noted that Child A was beginning to verbalise needs (“my turn”) but often became upset when peers did not immediately respond. Emerging pro-social skills identified included an initial awareness of fairness and early attempts at negotiating.\n2. Documenting strategies used by educatorsEducators modelled language for sharing (e.g., “Can I have a turn after you?”), facilitated turn-taking through timers, and praised cooperative moments. Thu documented these strategies in daily reflection notes and learning stories linked to EYLF Outcome 1 (Children have a strong sense of identity).\n3. Reviewing pre-existing informationThu reviewed past incident reports and family feedback, which highlighted that Child A experienced similar challenges at home, particularly when playing with siblings.\n4. Reviewing the environmentThe physical environment was adjusted to include duplicate popular resources (blocks, cars) to reduce conflict triggers. Social groupings were reviewed, and Child A was paired with a peer who modelled strong sharing behaviours.\n5. Observing and monitoring interactionsOngoing observations showed gradual progress – Child A began waiting for short periods and used teacher-modeled phrases in two out of three observed interactions.\n6. Collaborative discussionsThu held discussions with the family, who shared that they were practicing sharing at home using a “kitchen timer.” Educators and family agreed to use consistent strategies across settings.\n7. Documenting own reflectionsThu critically reflected that her initial approach (adult-directed sharing rules) was too rigid. She recognised the importance of scaffolding Child A’s agency by encouraging choice and voice in play.\n8. Developing, implementing, and evaluating a support planThu developed a support plan with colleagues and the family that included:\nUsing timers to structure turn-taking,\nProviding duplicate resources,\nEncouraging peer modelling,\nCelebrating cooperative behaviour with positive reinforcement\nAfter six weeks, Child A demonstrated greater self-regulation, waiting for 2–3 minutes and initiating turn-taking in group play. The plan was evaluated as effective but required ongoing monitoring to generalise skills across different play areas.\n\nChild B: 3 years old – difficulty regulating emotions during group transitions\n1. Observing and identifying emerging pro-social skillsThrough three observations (transition to mealtimes, pack-away time, and moving to outdoor play), Thu identified that Child B was beginning to use comfort objects and sought adult reassurance but often cried or resisted changes. Emerging skills included attempts to seek support and occasional use of peers as role models.\n2. Documenting strategies used by educatorsEducators used visual schedules, gave warnings before transitions, and paired Child B with a consistent “transition buddy.” Thu documented strategies in the program reflection journal and linked them to EYLF Outcome 3 (Children have a strong sense of wellbeing).\n3. Reviewing pre-existing informationInformation from the child’s enrolment and family discussions revealed that Child B had a strong attachment to routines at home and often struggled with unexpected changes.\n4. Reviewing the environmentThe routine was adjusted to include “five-minute warnings” before transitions. A calm corner with soft furnishings and visual aids was set up to provide Child B with a regulation space.\n5. Observing and monitoring interactionsThu observed Child B gradually responding more positively when transition warnings were used. Over time, he started following peers and using the visual schedule with adult support.\n6. Collaborative discussionsThu met with the family, who suggested using a favourite song during transitions. Educators incorporated this, which significantly reduced distress.\n7. Documenting own reflectionsThu reflected that her initial assumption that the child was being “defiant” was biased. Through reflection, she reframed behaviour as anxiety-driven and recognised the need for trauma-informed, empathetic approaches.\n8. Developing, implementing, and evaluating a support planThe plan for Child B included:\nVisual transition schedule,\nUse of comfort items,\nAdvance verbal warnings,\nIncorporating a “transition song” suggested by the family\nAfter four weeks, Child B displayed reduced crying episodes and began independently following the visual routine. The plan was evaluated as successful, though continued reinforcement and gradual withdrawal of adult prompts were recommended."
